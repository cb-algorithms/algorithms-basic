# Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

**Examples:**

```text
Input:
  totalItem: 4
  values: [10, 40, 30, 50]
  weights: [5, 4, 6, 3]
  totalWeight: 10
Output: 70
Explanation: [40, 30] has the largest total value (70) and has the total weight of 10
```

## Solutions
